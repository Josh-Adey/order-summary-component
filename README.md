### What I learned

 see below:

```html
I learned about buttons and their semantic meaning
<button class="submit" type="submit   " > Proceed to Payment </button>>
```
```css
Ileaned ow to style buttons.
.submit{
			height: 50px;
			margin-bottom:10px;
background-color:hsl(245, 75%, 52%);
		color:hsl(225, 100%, 98%);
		box-shadow:7px 10px 10px hsl(224, 23%, 55%);
		}

		.submit:hover{
			background-color:hsl(223, 47%, 23%);
			transition:background-color .5s;
		}
```
 a{
		  font-weight: 500;
		  font-size: 16px;
		 color:hsl(245, 75%, 52%);
		 transition:background-color .5s;
	  }

	  a:hover{
		  text-decoration: none;
		  
	  }
